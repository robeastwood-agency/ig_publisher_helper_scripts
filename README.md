# Helper scripts
This is a collection of personal scripts that provide some help with the FHIR IG publisher as well as git repositories generally.

## IG publisher:
1. Clean out various directories (such as txCache etc) - publisher_clean.sh
2. Invoke an auto-build, assuming that has been set up - invoke_repo_build.sh
